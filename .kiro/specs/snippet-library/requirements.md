# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Snippet Library is a developer productivity tool that provides reusable code snippets and components through a VS Code extension, with an optional web GUI for advanced management. The primary goal is to help developers accelerate their workflow and maintain consistency across projects by providing quick access to commonly used code patterns, with seamless integration into their existing development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing snippets THEN the system SHALL provide commands to edit existing snippets
2. WHEN editing a snippet THEN the system SHALL allow modification of code, title, description, language, and tags
3. WHEN deleting a snippet THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation
4. WHEN organizing snippets THEN the system SHALL support grouping by custom categories or tags

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to backup and share my snippet collections so that I can preserve my work and collaborate with team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting snippets THEN the system SHALL create a portable file format (JSON)
2. WHEN importing snippets THEN the system SHALL merge with existing snippets and handle conflicts
3. WHEN importing duplicate snippets THEN the system SHALL provide options to skip, overwrite, or rename
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL allow selective export by tags or categories

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the snippet library to integrate seamlessly with VS Code's existing snippet system so that I can use familiar workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code loads THEN the system SHALL register all custom snippets with the editor
2. WHEN using IntelliSense THEN the system SHALL display custom snippets alongside built-in suggestions
3. WHEN a snippet is triggered via prefix THEN the system SHALL expand it using VS Code's native snippet engine
4. WHEN snippets are modified THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh VS Code's snippet registry

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persistent local storage for my snippets so that my library is available across VS Code sessions and workspace changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code starts THEN the system SHALL load snippets from local storage
2. WHEN snippets are modified THEN the system SHALL automatically save changes to disk
3. WHEN switching workspaces THEN the system SHALL maintain access to global snippets
4. IF storage files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide error handling and recovery options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure snippet storage location so that I can choose between workspace-specific and global snippet libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring storage THEN the system SHALL support both workspace and global storage options
2. WHEN using workspace storage THEN snippets SHALL be stored in the current workspace directory
3. WHEN using global storage THEN snippets SHALL be accessible across all workspaces
4. WHEN switching storage modes THEN the system SHALL provide migration assistance

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want keyboard shortcuts for common snippet operations so that I can work efficiently without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL provide configurable key bindings for save, insert, and search operations
2. WHEN saving a snippet THEN the system SHALL support a quick-save shortcut that uses smart defaults
3. WHEN inserting snippets THEN the system SHALL support fuzzy search via keyboard
4. WHEN managing snippets THEN the system SHALL provide keyboard navigation for all operations

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want snippet validation and error handling so that I can trust the reliability of my snippet library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving a snippet THEN the system SHALL validate the snippet syntax for the specified language
2. WHEN loading snippets THEN the system SHALL handle corrupted or invalid snippet files gracefully
3. WHEN snippet operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with in-memory snippets and notify the user

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a web GUI for visual snippet management so that I can organize and manage large snippet collections more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web GUI THEN the system SHALL display all snippets in a visual grid or list format
2. WHEN viewing snippets in the GUI THEN the system SHALL show syntax-highlighted code previews
3. WHEN organizing snippets THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop reordering and categorization
4. WHEN the web GUI is opened THEN the system SHALL sync with the same local storage used by the VS Code extension

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced search and filtering in the web GUI so that I can quickly locate snippets in large collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching in the web GUI THEN the system SHALL provide real-time filtering with visual feedback
2. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL support multiple criteria including language, tags, date created, and content
3. WHEN viewing search results THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms in snippet previews
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms or filters

### Requirement 13

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting multiple snippets THEN the system SHALL provide bulk actions for delete, tag, and categorize
2. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
3. WHEN bulk editing tags THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, or replacing tags across selected snippets
4. WHEN bulk operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of changes made

### Requirement 14

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web GUI to communicate with the VS Code extension so that changes are synchronized between both interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria
